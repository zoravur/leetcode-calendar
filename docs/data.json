Because that's the trick we're going to use.\n\n* You can reverse a linked list by popping from the head and inserting at the head\n  * It's like two stacks.\n* If we keep popping the next node from the from the first node, `left`, and then inserting it\n  immediately after `left - 1`, because of the way that we encounter nodes the entire list will\n  become `..., left - 1, right, right - 1, ..., left + 1, left, right + 1, right + 2, ...`\n* The grand insight here is that it's all just splicing. That's why linked list ops often come\n  in 4 assignments. 2 to remove (save removed node, and assing prev.next = node.next), and\n  2 to splice (set node.next and new prev.next = node).\n\n## Solution\n\nTwo solutions this time.

A trivial example\n   is computing x^n: it can be decomposed in terms of x^(n%2) \\* x^(n/2) \\* x^(n/2), where x^(n/2)\n   can be computed once instead of twice / reused. This is the foundation of the exponentiation\n   by squaring algorithm which computes exponents in O(log n) time.\n2. optimal substructure - a problem where an optimal solution can be constructed efficiently from\n   an optimal solution to the subproblems. In this example, the optimal solution to determining\n   which houses to rob on the street can be decomposed as the problem of determining whether\n   to rob the current house or the house before it, provided all the houses to the left are\n   robbed optimally. To be more precise, assuming we know how best to rob the subarray \\[0, ..., i-1],\n   and \\[0, ..., i], whether to rob the (i+1)st house depends on whether the sum from \\[0, ..., i] is\n   larger than the sub from \\[0, ..., i-1] + nums\\[i]. Notice that we access the solution to the\n   subproblem \\[0, ..., i] twice, once when calculating whether to rob i+1 and once when calculating\n   i+2. If we didn't cache this with our dp array, we'd run into an exponential blowup, as each\n   problem depends on two smaller subproblems. But because they overlap, we can compute the solution\n   once instead of `2^recursion_depth`. And because of optimality, we are always going to rely\n   on the best known solution, instead of having to select a solution that isn't as good now\n   in order to get a better one later.\n\n## Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        if len(nums) < 2:\n            return sum(nums)\n        dp = [0] * len(nums)\n        dp[0] = nums[0]\n        dp[1] = max(nums[1], nums[0])\n        for i in range(2, len(nums)):\n            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])\n\n        return dp[len(dp)-1]\n\n```\n\n## Complexity\n\n* Time: O(n)\n* Space: O(n)\n\n## Results\n\nN/A\n\n## Next Steps\n\n* Could do well to create fewer bugs / false submissions\n\n## Notes\n\nN/A\n"

The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.\n\n## Approach\n\nFirst approach was to cheat a bit, just to see if it would work. `repr()` converts a python value to a\nstring that evaluates to the original value. Then, ast.literal\\_eval on the other side is the\n\"inverse\" of repr that definitely works for relatively simple things like lists of strings.\n\nHow does repr and ast.literal\\_eval encode values as python objects? Fundamentally, the core problem with\nany parsing task such as this is separating the data from the metadata. How do you know if something is\na value or not? That's done through program state. Roughly, here's the matrix:\n\n+---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Expecting \\ Actual  | Data                                                                 |  Metadata                                                  |\n+---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Data                | Normal parse                                                         |  dropped headers / fields; bad state, security risk likely |\n| Metadata            | Direct injection risk, very bad. User controls program control flow  |  Normal parse                                              |\n+---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nBecause we control both the encoder and the decoder, we can easily sync the initial state. We can either start with data/data,\nor metadata/metadata. How do we pick which is better?\n\nSuppose we chose our algorithm to start on data/data. Great. We start transmitting the string, one\ncharacter at a time. How do we know when the next string begins? We could emit a special character\nsequence, called a delimiter. but the problem is that the string itself could contain any possible\nascii sequence! That makes it impsosible to tell whether the delimiter represents the end of the\nstring, or is part of the string itself.\n\nHere, one possible approach is try to make this work by mapping some characters onto two character\nsequences -- we call this \"escaping\". For instance, we could say that strings are null terminated,\nalways ending in `chr(0)`, or `'\\0'`. But then, what happens if `chr(0)` is in the string itself? Then,\nwe would escape, letting `\"\\\\0\"` represent the null terminator if it's in a string. But then what\nabout `'\\'` itself? Well, we would map that one to `'\\\\'`. Now, `'\\'` is a special character that determines\nhow the next character is processed, and `chr(0)` actually never appears directly in the strings\nthemselves.\n\nThis is complicated! Luckily, there is a simpler approach, which is what I used. If we switch to\nmetadata/metadata to start, we can include everything needed to process the first string right at\nthe beginning. If we prefix each string with its length, we can process the following data\nup to that length, before switching back to processing metadata. here's what I mean:\n\n```\n[\"Hello\", \"world\"] -> [5Hello5world]\n```\n\nDecoding, we read off the number at the start, process that many characters and append it to our list,\nwhich reverses the above.\n\nThere's some problems with this approach. How do we know when the number ends? What if\nthe string starts with a number, For instance, take the following cases:\n\n```\n[\"verylongstring\", \"wow\"] -> 14verylongstring3wow\n[\"1337\", \"speak\"] -> 413375speak\n```\n\nIn the first example, we read off multiple digits to handle a string over 9 characters. All's well and good,\nwe can just stop parsing after the first non-digit. But as soon as we try to implement that, the second\ncase bites us: we try to read a string of length 413375, not knowing that the first string actually\nconsists of the numbers \"1337\".\n\nHere, we need only introduce a separator between the number and the string it represents. ',' works fine\n\\-- it unambiguously signals the end of the number.\n\nThis works and is the most flexible approach, but it's a bit annoying that the number spans multiple characters.\nSo, I noticed that the max string length was 200 <= 255 = 2^8-1, the max size of a char, meaning we could use a\nsingle character to store the length.\n\nSo that's how my solution deviates. I use a single char/byte anyway, relying on the fact that strings are at most\n200 characters long. But even if we allowed infinite length strings, the previous approach still works.\n\nI also add a 255 as a control character to determine the end of the sequence. This is not required for the\nproblem, as we have the full string and can check if the string is empty. But in real network scenarios,\nwe might run into a situation where we are streaming data and it's not obvious that the data is finished.\nWhich is why I included that.\n\n## Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n\n    def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:\n        return ''.join(s for t in zip((chr(len(s)) for s in strs), strs) for s in t) + chr(255)\n\n    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:\n        res = []\n        while ord(s[0]) != 255:\n            l = ord(s[0])\n            res.append(s[1:l+1])\n            s = s[l+1:]\n        return res\n\n\n```\n\n## Complexity\n\n* Time: O(n)\n* Space: O(n)\n\n## Results\n\nN/A (neetcode)\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNeed to improve explanation.

The key (no pun intended) is realizing that\nthe range of frequency values are bounded -- the highest possible frequency is n itself,\nbecause there are at most n elements in the array. It forms a partition.\n\nThat means that if we can somehow look up elements based on their frequency, we can\njust iterate from n down to 0, printing the first k elements we encounter.\n\nTherefore, we need only to maintain a grouping of elements by their frequency (which we can hold\nin an array because the key values are 0..n), which we can during the count, or after, all in\none shot.

      "markdown": "## Approach\n\nThis is a pretty standard backtracking problem. You generate all the possible boards, but save only the ones\nthat are valid. Halfway through, I generated some binary strings as practice:\n\n```python\ndef binaryStringsRec(l: int):\n    result = []\n    if l == 0:\n        result.append([])\n        return result\n    for c in ['0', '1']:\n        for s in binaryStringsRec(l-1):\n            result.append([c]+s)\n    return result\n\ndef binaryStrings(l=8):\n    return [''.join(s) for s in binaryStringsRec(l)];\n```\n\nIn all backtracking problems, we need a way to generate correct partial results (that are correct),\nand progressively build them into full solutions. A binary string consists of 0 or 1 prepended to\na binary string. If length is a parameter, it determines our base case. In the n-queens problem,\na valid solutions is a board where no queens are attacking each other, and our base case is when\nthe number of queens is equal to the number of rows and columns on the board (because we can't\nplace more).\n\nIf we can swap out the logic in the recursive helper, by enumerating and combining board positions\ninstead of 0s or 1s, we'd be well on our way to generating a correct solution.\n\nI started by thinking about my board representation. I decided to go with an unrolled list of length n\\*n,\nas in a matrix in row major order. The two primary advantages of this approach (as opposed to a list\nof lists) is that I need only one integer as my index, and that it makes cloning easier (via slicing).\nThen I started thinking of a way to generate queen moves from a queen position. It was easiest to\nthink of this in 2d, so I just created two small helpers to convert to and from a 2d index. And those\nhelpers gave me a nice opportunity to detect moves off the board as well, so I added that.\n\nThen, in an effort to simplify things further, I wrote markQueenMoves, and made it modify an existing\nboard instead of returning a new board. This allowed me to not worry about combining moves from two\nboards, as I might do if I were writing in a more functional style. This was a choice out of convenience.\n\nsolveNQueensRec is the meat of the logic. But that too isn't terribly complicated. You can't place a\nqueen on a covered square, and once you've placed a queen, if it's your last queen, you're done, and\nif it's not, you place the current queen, and then call the function again to place the remaining\nqueens. We return an list because we're accumulating results, not just determining if a solution\nexists. naturally, an empty list corresponds to no solutions, which means we can combine lists using\nthe + operator, or via append / extend.\n\nsolveNQueens is just a wrapper for the recursive helper, and the signature required by the question.\n\nAfter testing on a 9x9 board, there was just one small wrinkle -- TLE. Turns out you can't enumerate\nEVERY possible queen position as it's too inefficient. There are three levels to the inefficiency:\n\n1. True (n^2)!/(n^2-n)! -- least efficient, but every possible enumeration counting duplicates\n2. (n^2)Cn -- easy if you constrain each queen to start after the one placed before it. Cuts down by a n! factor.\n3. Row-wise enumeration (just snuck me into passing). Force each queen to start on a new row, but\n   that's all. This leverages the fact that new queens should be on new rows, but there's probably\n   more optimizations you could make.\n\n## Complexity\n\n* Time: O(n^n)\n  Reason: We try every row and every column at most once\n* Space: O(?)\n  Not sure on this one. My initial thought was the number of active boards is proportional to the depth of\n  recursion, so O(n^3) because each board is O(n^2) and recursion depth is O(n). But if we count the solution\n  size, it gets more complicated and turns into a counting problem. An upper bound for it is O(n!n!)\n  (permutations of rows and columns) but that's also wildly overestimating the set of solutions that are\n  valid.\n\n## Results\n\n119ms (5.58th percentile)\n18.29MB (42.66%)\n\nNot good, but not bad for a first hard problem after being rusty.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI intend to revisit this problem. I think an approach where you slot each queen into a row, column, and\ndiagonals, might lead to a faster solution.\n\n## Notes\n\n* pretty standard backtracking.\n* i'm sure we could do some invariant stuff with eightfold symmetry, but let's keep it\n* simple to start.\n* brute force with backtracking.\n* We'll need a way to mark off squares that are covered.\n* We'll also need a way to mark off covered squares every time we place a queen.\n* We could use a boolean array from 1..n^2 for this.\n* but first we need a way to generate queen moves.\n"
